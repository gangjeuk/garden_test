### Inline code

You can format code within a sentence using single backticks.

```md
Text inside `backticks` on a line will be formatted like code.
```

This is Hello World `Hello World`

## External links

If you want to link to an external URL, you can create an inline link by surrounding the link text in brackets (`[ ]`), and then the URL in parentheses (`( )`).

```md
[Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md)
```
## Supported formats for internal links

Obsidian supports the following link formats:

- Wikilink: `[[Three laws of motion]]`
- Markdown: `[Three laws of motion](Three%20laws%20of%20motion.md)`
### Escape blank spaces in links

If your URL contains blank spaces, you need to escape them by replacing them with ==`%20`==.

```md
[My Note](obsidian://open?vault=MainVault&file=My%20Note.md)
```

You can also escape the URL by wrapping it with angled brackets (`< >`).

```md
[My Note](<obsidian://open?vault=MainVault&file=My Note.md>)
```

## Link to a heading in a note

You can link to specific headings in notes, also known as _anchor links_.

To link to a heading, add a hashtag (`#`) at the end of the link destination, followed by the heading text.

For example, `[[Three laws of motion#Second law]]`.

You can add multiple hashtags for each subheading.

For example, `[[My note#Heading 1#Heading 2]]`.
## External images

You can add images with external URLs, by adding a `!` symbol before an [external link](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#External%20links).

```md
![Engelbart](https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/images/Engelbart.jpg)
```

### Task lists

To create a task list, start each list item with a hyphen and space followed by `[ ]`.

```md
- [x] This is a completed task.
- [ ] This is an incomplete task.
```


You can use any character inside the brackets to mark it as complete.

```md
- [x] Milk
- [?] Eggs
- [-] Eggs
```

- [x] Milk
- [?] Eggs
- [-] Eggs

## Footnotes

You can add footnotes to your notes using the following syntax:

```md
This is a simple footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is the referenced text.
[^2]: Add 2 spaces at the start of each new line.
  This lets you write footnotes that span multiple lines.
[^note]: Named footnotes still appear as numbers, but can make it easier to identify and link references.
```


# Callouts
```markdown
> [!info]
> Here's a callout block.
> It supports **Markdown**, [[Internal link|Wikilinks]], and [[Embed files|embeds]]!
> ![[og-image.png]]
```

> [!Info]
> Here's a callout block.  
> It supports **Markdown**, [Wikilinks](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links) and [embeds](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Embedding+files)!

> [!example] 
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
> 

> [!quote] 
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

> [!bug] 
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

> [!danger] 
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

> [!error] 
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

> [!failure] 
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

> [!warning] 
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

> [!question] 
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

> [!success] 
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

> [!tip] 
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

> [!todo] 
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

> [!abstract] 
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

> [!note] 
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

> [!question] Can callouts be nested? 
> > [!todo] Yes!, they can.
> > > [!example] You can even use multiple layers of nesting.


> [!tip] Title-only callout
### Foldable callouts

You can make a callout foldable by adding a plus (+) or a minus (-) directly after the type identifier.

A plus sign expands the callout by default, and a minus sign collapses it instead.
> [!faq]- 
> Are callouts foldable? > Yes! In a foldable callout, the contents are hidden when the callout is collapsed.
